        A Promise is like a placeholder to do something for somebody in future  <br/>
        Helps in Asynchrounous programming      <br/>
        Same functionality as that of callback but with lesser code<br/>
        Takes one internal function as argument.   <br/>
        The funtion in argument itself can have two parameters <br/>
        which are resolve(which means work done) and reject which means error<br/>
        THe promise must return something to be consumed by the then function. <br/>
        the function.then will again contain two paramters as functions   <br/>
        The first one for success function, the second one for error function.  <br/>
        The data of resolve and reject becomes avaiable in success and error of then()     <br/>
